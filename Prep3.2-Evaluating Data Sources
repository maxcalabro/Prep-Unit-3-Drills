1) Airbnb data for Amsterdam on Christmas Eve. Airbnb data is likely to be substantially different on Christmas than on other days of the year, and likely fluctuates with the tourist seasons in general.

2) Mental health data from SF and NYC on 9/12/01. The day after 9/11 was not representative of mental health as a whole, and probably was worse in NYC than SF. 

3) Armenian Pub Data. Data was collected from an online survey, so it's actually measuring which pubs are popular amongst the online-survey-filling-out population, not the population as a whole.
